    <h1>COMPUTER FUNDAMENTALS</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>ABOUT THE COMPUTER</h2>
    <p>A <dfn> computer </dfn> is a machine that uses electronics to input, process, store, and output data. Data is
        information such
        as numbers, words, and lists. Input of data means to read information from a keyboard, a storage device like a
        hard drive, or a sensor. The computer processes or changes the data by following the instructions in software
        programs.</p>
    <p>Computer also helps us to make a chemical equations.</p>
    <p>For Example:- <strong>A + O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub></strong></p>
    <hr />
    <h3>BILL GATES</h3>
    <p>In the world of computers and technology also, there have been many famous people. One of these is Bill Gates.
        Who is one of the most successful entrepreneurs in history and has revolutionized the way the world uses
        computers. He is respected the world over for making computers simple and accessible to the common man.</p>
    <p><strong> DO YOU KNOW? </strong></p>
    <p><b>Bill Gates</b> was the Founder of the <em>Microsoft</em> <del>Computer</del>.</p>
    <hr />
    <h3>RAM & ROM</h3>
    <p><abbr title="Random Access Memory"><strong>RAM</strong></abbr> is a type of <em>volatile memory.</em> RAM uses
        transistors to store data,
        and these need electricity to work. Every time you shut down your computer, anything stored on this memory
        disappears. In other words: RAM is easily added to or changed.</p>
    <p><abbr title="Read-Only Memory"><strong>ROM</strong></abbr> is a non-volatile memory type. This means it receives
        data and
        permanently writes it on a chip, and it lasts even after you turn off your computer.</p>
    <br />
    <hr />
    <p> <b>WHAT DOES MEAN BY VOLATILE MEMORY?</b></p>
    <p> Volatile memory is <strong>the memory that can keep the information only during the time it is powered
            up.</strong> In other
        words, volatile memory requires power to maintain the information.</p>
    <p> The main difference between the two is that <strong>volatile memory requires power to maintain its data, while
            non-volatile memory does not.</strong> This means that if power is lost, all data stored in volatile memory
        will be lost,
        while non volatile memory will retain its data.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>MOTHERBOARD</h4>
    <p>A <strong>computer’s motherboard</strong> is typically the largest printed circuit board in a machine’s chassis.
        It distributes
        electricity and facilitates communication between and to the <abbr
            title="Central Processing Unit"><b>CPU</b></abbr>,
        <abbr title="Random Acces Memory"><b>RAM</b></abbr> , and any other component of the computer’s hardware. There
        is a broad range of motherboards, each of which
        is intended to be compatible with a specific model and size of the computer.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h5>GRAPHICAL PROCESSING UNIT</h5>
    <p>The <abbr title="Graphical Processing Unit">GPU</abbr> is the computer hardware responsible for it. A GPU is
        required for your
        computer to read and reproduce graphical representations and effects, which are almost present in every form of
        media today.</p>
    <hr />
    <h6>PROCESSOR</h6>
    <p>A <strong>Processor (CPU)</strong> is the logic circuitry that responds to and processes the basic instructions
        that drive a
        computer. The CPU is seen as the main and most crucial<abbr title="Integrated Circuitry">IC</abbr>chip in a
        computer, as it is
        responsible for interpreting most of computers commands.</p>
